        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Faras Nobary, a third-year Business Technology Management student at Toronto Metropolitan University. I have a deep passion for leadership and entrepreneurship, which has driven my success both academically and professionally. During my time at university, I’ve balanced my studies with playing varsity soccer at York University, coaching youth at Prime FC Academy, and taking on leadership roles within student organizations.

            I have hands-on experience in various industries, from working as a dining room server at The Keg Steakhouse to founding and scaling my own luxury brand, Saffron & Caviar, in Qatar. I’ve learned the value of resilience and adaptability through challenges, such as setting up a retail store in Hamad International Airport and building strong relationships with key players in the hospitality sector. My entrepreneurial venture scaled to an annual revenue of $1.75M.

            With a strong foundation in business technology and process optimization, combined with expertise in data analysis and IT infrastructure, I am passionate about driving innovation. I look forward to further exploring how technology and business intersect to create value, and I am always eager to take on new challenges.
